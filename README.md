# Hurlord - TUI API Debugging client based on hurl


Hurl is great but having an editor and terminal constantly open and having to switch between them can be a bit unergonomic :/. This TUI client strives to provide excellent user experience via simplicity, ergonomic keybindigs and the NeoVim editor. 

Superiority to Postman/Insomnia/Hopscotch/virtually every rest client
- No electron, forget about the start time. Hurlord can be ready to use in less than 25ms.
- No more constant nagging to log into some sync feature you donâ€™t use. Do the syncing on your terms as everything is file based and easily git-able.
- No unnecessary branding or buttons that you never touch.
- Reliable file history.
- Powered by an actual CI/CD tool, seamless integration with the pipelines

As you can see, Hurlord boosts great features already but it is very much still in development and I welcome any contributors to join me and build the best rest api client there is (which is a pretty low bar if you ask me)
