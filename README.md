# Hurlui - TUI API Debugging client based on hurl


Hurl is great but having an editor and terminal constantly open and having to switch between them can be a bit unergonomic :/. This TUI client strives to provide excellent user experience via simplicity, ergonomic keybindings and the NeoVim editor. 

Superiority to Postman/Insomnia/Hopscotch/virtually every rest client
- No electron, forget about the start time. Hurlui can be ready to use in less than 25ms.
- No more constant nagging to log into some sync feature you donâ€™t use. Do the syncing on your terms as everything is file based and easily git-able.
- No unnecessary branding or buttons that you never touch.
- Reliable file history.
- Powered by an actual CI/CD tool, seamless integration with the pipelines

# Install guide
1. Install neovim and hurl
2. Clone repository ``` git clone https://github.com/Kuchteq/hurlui.git ```
3. Make sure hurlui and executer are executable. ```chmod u+x hurlui executer```
4. Run hurlui

As you can see, Hurlui boosts great features already, but it is very much still in development and I welcome any contributors to join me and build the best rest API client there is (which is a pretty low bar if you ask me)
